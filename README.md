The game SquareCells for the TI-NSpire calculator

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  This is a clone of the game SquareCells.  It works on the TI-NSpire (CX) with ndless 3.1 and higher.

It is played where you need to go through every cell on the board.  Either mark the cell or remove the cell.

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop the nSquareCells-gc.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 or higher on your calculator in order to run it!

Also included is an external level.  You can add that to your calculator as well.  Once you start the main game it will register the .sqc extension; then you can run the level to play it.

How to play:
Every square must be marked as either not part of the pattern and removed; or part of the pattern and marked with the little square on the corner.

You use the arrow keys to move around as well as the 2,4,6,8 keys.  Use the Ctrl key to remove a square that isn't part of the pattern; and the Shift key to mark a spare as part of the pattern.

A number to the side(s) of the board means the number of consecutive spots that are part of the pattern.  If multiple numbers then there is a gap of at least one spot between the consecutive spots.

A number inside brackets (e.g. [3]) means there are that many total squares in that row/column part of the pattern.

No number for a row/column means no information.

A square with a number means that spot is part of a group of connected squares of that size.  The squares do not connect diagonally.

If you guess wrong you can keep playing.
